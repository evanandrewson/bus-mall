1. Make file scaffold.
2. Make hard-coded HTML.
3. Add CSS.
4. Make a product array with id, image, and name
5. TDD a function to get an item from the array based on a number. -- realized this is unnecessary
6. Make a render function to display items from the array.
7. Make sure the render function includes button functionality that:
    a. tracks the clicks for that product
    b. resets the page with 3 new items.
8. Use a random number generator to select 3 products to render.
    a. make sure no dupes are shown
    b. tracks what images were shown
9. After 25 rounds, show results and hide images
10. Stretch - save the results to local storage and show overall results on new page.
